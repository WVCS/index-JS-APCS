          <td> Pretty basic if you ask me. But it goes great with many things, like pie and... pie. </td>

        <tr>
          <td> Banana </td>
          <td> We all know the mushy brown parts are edible, but no one will judge you if you cut it off anyway. Do monkeys even really like bananas that much? </td>

        <tr>
          <td> Blueberry </td>
          <td> Blueberries on their own are... eh. I really only eat them in muffins and pancakes. Also, have you ever seen blueberry flavored candy? What the heck is a blue raspberry? </td>

        <tr>
          <td> Cherry </td>
          <td> A very good flavor for candy. Cherries from jars are better than "real" cherries. The ones with seeds are too much work. </td>

          <td> Grapefruit </td>
          <td> I'm not sure how or if other people eat grapefruit, but this fruit should only be eaten with at least a cup of sugar poured in. </td>

          <td> Grapes </td>
          <td> Best. Literally the best fruit ever. Artificial or natural. </td>

          <td> Lemons </td>
          <td> Only really enjoyable when in drink form. Don't tell me you eat them as they come, you'd die. </td>

        <tr>
          <td> Orange </td>
          <td> Really good, but its hard to find the perfect orange with all of their weird skin stuff. It even got a color named after it. Or is it the other way around? </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> Peach </td>
          <td> Tastes good I guess, but they're kinda messy to eat. Can't really trust fruits with big secret pits inside just waiting to choke someone whose never eaten a peach before. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> Pear </td>
          <td> Kind of like apples. Don't really eat them that much. If apples were Mario, pears would be Luigi. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> Persimmon </td>
          <td> One of those fruits that look like a vegetable. Tastes like cinnamon and sugar! </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> Pineapple </td>
          <td> Very tangy and citrus-y. Don't eat too much or your tongue will pay big time. </td>

          <td> Star fruit </td>
          <td> Never had one before, but it looks cool. </td>

          <td> Strawberry </td>
          <td> A baker's favorite fruit. Featured in many desserts. Gets along with tons of other flavors. </td>

          <td> Watermelon </td>
          <td> If it's just water, then why does it taste so good? Some people eat it with salt. </td>
