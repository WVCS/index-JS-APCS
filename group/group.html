    <h1>The Brigade</h1>
    <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; padding-bottom: 5%;">Captain Toad stars in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker as a playable main character along with Toadette, who joins the Brigade. All of the other members of the Toad Brigade also appear in various stages to help the captain: Blue Toad gives him Super Gems or Super Mushrooms upon being found, Yellow Toad sleeps and can additionally cause Captain Toad or Toadette to fall asleep should they stand near him, and Green Toad is seen reading a map in most of his appearances throughout the game. Each Toad wears an explorer outfit with a backpack to match Captain Toad's.
<br></br>
      Enjoying the festivities in Peach's Castle during the Star Festival, a Toad and his friends are scattered across the galaxy after Bowser carries Peach's castle into outer space. They eventually escaped, along with Luigi, until they are separated from him and are later discovered by Mario in the Honeyhive Galaxy, where he rescues them.
Shortly afterwards, the Toads join Mario at the Comet Observatory, where they decide to help him in his quest to gather the Grand Stars, and move their base of operations to the Garage. After the Lumas help them build a spaceship, the Starshroom, the Toads form the Toad Brigade and start traveling in order to find Power Stars with Mario. They are then seen throughout several galaxies in search for the stars, and often cheer Mario on during battles. They often arrive to provide a Launch Star to Mario on their ship in order to help him progress. In the Grand Finale Galaxy, where they show up for the final time, their leader reveals that because of their work in helping Mario retrieve the stars, they have been promoted to Royal Guards.

          <h2>Captain Toad</h2>
       <p>
Despite being the leader of the Toad Brigade organization, Captain Toad is extremely cowardly. His cowardice often leads to his fellow Toad Brigade members to talk negatively about the Captain behind his back. The captain also tends to be accident-prone and as a result, often lands himself into danger. Captain Toad can also be seen to be lazy as he can be seen daydreaming about relaxing. He also appears to be extremely quick at making tall tales to make himself appear braver than he truly is to the rest of his brigade members.
Regardless of his negative traits, he is seen to be highly resourceful. He also rewards Mario or Luigi with coins to replenish health and even power-ups. Captain Toad does occasionally find Power Stars himself; however, he is always ready to give it to either Mario or Luigi in an attempt to help the hero in his adventures as well as for the cause of saving the universe.
Captain Toad is described to being the "fearless" hunter of Green Stars and proves this title by being on a constant hunt for the exclusive stars despite lacking the ability to jump. He constantly rewards Mario, Luigi, Toad, Princess Peach, and Rosalina with Green Stars or coins and Power-Ups when encountered.
Captain Toad is somewhat greedy, as he cannot help but try to snag any treasure he sees.

    <h2>Archivist Toadette</h2>
    <p>
      Toadette appears in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker as a playable character alongside Captain Toad. Her appearance is made to resemble Captain Toad, as she wears a similar explorer's outfit. While treasure hunting with Captain Toad, Wingo appears and grabs the Power Star the Toads just retrieved. While the Captain gets knocked over, she tries to grab back the Power Star, but fails; instead, Wingo flies away with both the Star and Toadette. After a long journey, Captain Toad arrives to Wingo's Watchtower, defeats Wingo and saves Toadette.
Then, the two Toads go treasure hunting again, but after retrieving a Power Star, Wingo appears once more. This time, the Toads play opposite roles. Toadette gets knocked over, while the Captain tries to grab the Star back, but instead gets carried away by Wingo with the Star in hand. Toadette goes off to save the Captain and after the Captain is saved, Wingo appears and takes both the Power Star and Toadette again.
In the third episode, Wingo taunts the Captain, then flies away. While flying, he loses Toadette and she sets off to find the Captain. In the second-to-last level, Toadette retrieves yet another Power Star, but upon doing so, Wingo steals both the Star and Toadette. Captain Toad then fights and defeats Wingo for the second and last time to save Toadette.</p>

    <h2>Blue Toad</h2>
      <p>
Of the Toad Brigade, Blue Toad is shown to be the smartest of the five Toads and provides Mario with some very useful information about the galaxies. To show his intelligence, Blue Toad wears glasses and is known as the "smart one".</p>

    <h2>Green Toad</h2>
 <p>
  Green Toad proves to be a hardworking Toad and is often seen investigating various maps in certain levels. He directly helps Captain Toad in certain situations in which he could follow behind the Captain alongside the other members of the Toad Brigade to help him reach difficult areas.</p>

    <h2>Yellow Toad</h2>
    <p>
       Yellow Toad is almost always seen sleeping. His sleepiness is seen to be contagious as he is capable of even making Captain Toad fall asleep beside him if he stands near him. However, there are instances in which Yellow Toad aids the Captain and is seen to be fully awake.</p>

    <td>A Super Mushroom is a red mushroom that serves a particular function depending on the game in which it is found. Its first and most common effect is causing Small Mario to turn into his Super form, allowing him to smash through bricks and take an extra hit from enemies. The Poison Mushroom can be considered its opposite, a mushroom item that hurts the player. Both this and the standard mushroom are designed after the poisonous Amanita muscaria, with the shape resembling a button mushroom.</td>

    <td>The Double Cherry is an item first appearing in Super Mario 3D World. The Double Cherry's conception comes from the result of a mistake made by a staff member with the placement tool, which created two player Marios. The staff thought it was a good idea and decided to implement it in the game. Double Cherries also appear in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS ports, acting just like they did in Super Mario 3D World. They are featured in puzzle-based levels, where the player must control two Captain Toads at the same time.</td>

    <td>A POW Block is a common block in the Mario franchise. In all games they appear in, their effect when thrown to the ground or hit in the air will cause a large earthquake, causing all enemies on screen to get hurt. POW Blocks can be carried and thrown in most games, and some are required for a 100% game completion. Most POW Blocks are a metallic blue, but some POW Blocks are red or sometimes green.</td>

If Captain Toad picks one up, he will swing it repeatedly in front of him, breaking certain objects in his way such as Brick Blocks. After a certain amount of time, the pickax will disappear. The Super Pickax can also be used to defeat enemies, and it works in a similar way to a Super Star.</td>

    <td><img style="width: 200px;" src="https://github.com/WVCS/index-JS-APCS/blob/main/group/media/group_site/Turnip.png?raw=true"></td>
    <td>Turnips make their true 3D debut in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and reappear in its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS ports. They can be plucked from Pluck Patches by Captain Toad or Toadette and thrown to attack enemies. They award one coin when they hit a surface or an enemy. Turnips can also be used to unlock or discover new pathways by throwing them at obstacles such as POW blocks. In the minecart levels of the game, Captain Toad rides a minecart full of turnips that can be thrown in many angles at his surrounding environment. Some levels also contain turnip-shooting cannons, starting with Turnip Cannon Jungle. Additionally, Captain Toad can throw turnips at Super Gems to obtain them without having to grab them himself.</td>

    <td>In Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS ports, if Captain Toad or Toadette lose enough lives in a level, an Assist Pluck Patch will appear containing an Invincibility Mushroom. Plucking it and collecting the mushroom will cause either Toad to glow, similar to a Super Star. However, the effect lasts until the end of the level, making it easier for them to deal with tough enemies, leaving any puzzles within the stage as the only remaining challenge(s). The Invincibility Mushroom item is very similar to the Invincibility Leaf item from Super Mario 3D Land, New Super Mario Bros. 2, and Super Mario 3D World.</td>

They serve the same purpose as Green Stars in Super Mario 3D World, Star Coins in the New Super Mario Bros. series and Star Medals in Super Mario 3D Land, and as said items, they are scattered around the stages, and sometimes a certain puzzle must be done to collect them. As in Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World, they are used to unlock some levels.</td>
