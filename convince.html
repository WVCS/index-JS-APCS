      On May 15, 2006, the world was introduced to New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS. It sold over 30 million copies worldwide, and was the best-selling game for the DS as well as one of the best-selling games of all time. The game is beloved for its design, music, and classic Mario sound effects. </p>
      
      <p style="padding:6px; text-align: left;"> 
      Today, many people look back fondly at the time they spent playing the game and enjoying all of its charm. A very memorable aspect of the game was its sound effects compressed by the quality of the system's speakers. But this speaker compression has caused many to question the voice clips that Mario says throughout the game. </p>

    <p style="padding:6px; text-align: left;"> 
      One clip that left many in question was the line that Mario says upon reaching the end of a level. </p>

      Logically, you may believe that Mario is saying "That's-a so nice!", but I have determined that he is,         in fact, saying "Texas on ice!" There's undeniable evidence to prove this. </p>
  </div>
      
    <iframe style="margin-top: 40px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/31aoE43Ke2g?start=105" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <div id="proof" class="pageDivider" style="width:80%; display:block; background-color: black;">
    <div class="convinceDiv" style="width:700px; float:left; margin:40px 0 0 40px;">
    <p style="padding:6px; text-align: left;"> 
      If you take a look at the Texas state flag, you will see that its colors are red, white, and blue. These three colors are also featured in Mario's main attire, so what does this mean? </p>
      
      <p style="padding:6px; text-align: left;"> 
      We all know Mario is very territorial over Princess Peach, and would do anything to get her back from Bowser. Applying this information to this case, Mario has the same feelings about the colors of his clothes, naturally. </p>

    <img class="smooth_img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Flag_of_Texas.svg/1200px-Flag_of_Texas.svg.png" width="465px" style="margin:40px 40px 0 0; float:right;">
   </div>
    
    <div id="conclusion" class="pageDivider" style="width:80%; display:block; background-color: black;">
    <div class="convinceDiv" style="width:700px; float:left; margin:40px 0 0 40px;">
    <p style="padding:6px; text-align: left;"> 
      Mario's message to Texas is now clear: he is warning the state that it's on thin ice for stealing his iconic color scheme and using it for their flag. </p>
      
      <p style="padding:6px; text-align: left;"> 
      If you don't believe me then something is very wrong. You don't know how to think; I mean just look at yourself, the world's told you that Mario says "That's-a so nice!" and you've just gone with that for years. The next thing you know, you'll be told that oxygen doesn't taste good, so you'll have to stop breathing it. Then you'd die and it'll be your brain's fault. </p>
  </div>
    <img src="images/main_imgs/mario_v_texas.png" width="465px" style="margin:40px 40px 0 0; float:right;">
   </div>
    
    <div id="action" class="pageDivider" style="width:80%; display:block; background-color: black;">
    <div class="convinceDiv" style="width:700px; float:left; margin:40px 0 0 40px;">
    <p style="padding:6px; text-align: left;"> 
      If you don't want to die, then all you have to do is listen to me and believe everything I tell you. My brain is a certified thinker and I don't even need to prove it because you already believe me like I told you to above. </p>
      
      <p style="padding:6px; text-align: left;"> 
      So what can you do with this information? Well, Mario is completely unstoppable so if he ever snaps and comes after Texas, you'll have to kiss it good-bye. For now, just be grateful that he hasn't notices that the entire United States Flag is just as guilty of color scheme theft, and while you're at it, take a break from that oxygen, it doesn't taste good. </p>
